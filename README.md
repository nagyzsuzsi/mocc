# Overview
This repository contains the prototpye implementation of the proposed Multi-perspective Online Conformance Checking (MOCC) approach presented in the paper __*An Alignment-based Multi-Perspective Online Conformance Checking Technique*__ by Zsuzsanna Nagy and Agnes Werner-Stark which is available [here](https://acta.uni-obuda.hu/Nagy_Werner-Stark_122.pdf).

This prototype was implemented using version 2.7.12 of the [PM4Py library](https://github.com/process-intelligence-solutions/pm4py) and [the implementation of the proposed incremental A* approach](https://github.com/fit-daniel-schuster/online_process_monitoring_using_incremental_state-space_expansion_an_exact_algorithm). The source code of the incremental A* algorithm was modified and integrated into this version of PM4Py. Additionally, program codes were developed to allow importing DPN process models from PNML files and to generate and solve a MILP problem for determining the OVAs based on the given variable writings and guard functions.
